              The thematic idea in this section of the project is Beneatha's want for true love.
              I'm focusing on making a dating profile that I beleive she would like. I am going to be appealing
              to the fact that she is an intellectual with the want of real love, not money. I chose this highly
              red pallet for the fact that she wants love not money, therefore its red like a heart.

                I love having deep conversations, helping others and learning new things! I am going to school
                to be a doctor because my dream is to help others. It's intellectually stimulating and I think
                if you're also going to school we may be compatible. I'm not... traditional, I will not let
                anyone tell me what I can and can't do, and that includes you, I am going to be what I want
                regardless of what you think of it. Not to mention if I don't feel a connection to you I will
                NOT stay! No ammount of money can keep me in your arms, if we don't connect, its over.

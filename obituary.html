              The thematic idea in this section of the project is the hatrid of races,
              mainly the idea that the family could get hurt by moving to the new neighborhood.
              Since this is based on an Obituary I decided to make the color pallet one of a light brown coffin.

                Walter Lee Younger, came home unknowing of what would happen that day.
                Walter Lee came home, sat on his lazy boy that resided in the new home.
                He sat there not knowing he'd be murdered that day, killed by a white man.
              </p>
              <p>
                Walter was not only a husband, but a father, a brother, and a son.
                Due to racial prejudice he was taken from us all.
                He may not have made the best choices all his life, but he was family.
                Walter Lee had his heart in the right place. He was a good man taken from us all to early.

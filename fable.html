            <h4>
              This project will be a fable based on the main theme of Walter Lee's constant scheming and imagining of great things, so much so that he loses thousands of dollars just to chase that dream.
              As we know this investment ended rather badly. I choose the color pallet of green as to allude to his greed. I chose the two characters as animals for a specific reason, that reason being
              to relate to Asop's Fables, two stories, one involving greed (being the dog), and gullibility (the raven).

            <h4>
              A raven lay awake on a thin branch, <br>
              A single wheat seed lay in his mouth when suddenly he spots a dog, <br>
              This dog, looking rather rugged stumbles upon the raven eyeing him, <br>
              The dog walks up to the raven, pleads, begs, and whimpers asking for the seed, <br>
              The dog tells the raven "Please Mr. please! I beg of you, if you give me the seed I will come back with bread!", <br>
              "You will now? Do you promise?" the raven asks somewhat reluctantly, but noticably interested, <br>
              "Of course! I know a farmer! He can grow the seeds!" said that dog, <br>
              The seed, now transfered to the dog, gets taken to a farmer, <br>
              The wheat grows, gets sold, and the raven, waiting at that tree wonders, "how long does wheat take to grow? When will he be back" <br>

            <h3> The Moral </h3>
            <h4><i>When one is without caution and foresight, gullibility sets in and it will surely be exploited.</i></h4>
